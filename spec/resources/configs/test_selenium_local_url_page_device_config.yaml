# Test config file for running Wraith-Selenium using selenium locally
# and url-based comparison and a locally attached device.
# The configuration below was used for running selenium webdriver on a
# iPad 2 device attached to a MacPro computer. However wraith-selenium
# has been shown to work for locally-attached Android devices as well.
#
# This file can be used as a template for production configuration.

#The attributes defined as default_parameters in the section beneath this one

#This would be necessary if you wanted to run a mixture of desktop
#and device browsers or maybe multiple locally attached devices.
#For example:
#  safari:
#    desktop:
#    device:
#      :url: http://192.168.1.69:3001/wd/hub/

#you can define some default parameters to pass to the selenium driver here.
#You can also leave blank as all optional, but don't delete the key structure
#Note the necessity when running Wraith-Selenium against a locally attached device
#of defining both a url for the selenium webdriver running  on the locally
#attached device and the actual device name.

#very annoyingly and weirdly, selenium often interprets screenshot sizes differently from those
#stipulated in your window dimensions. Offset behaviour seems inconsistent between browsers,
#browser versions and between different widths.
#Your first run using selenium using browser-based comparison may well result in some
#invalid diff comparisons due to screen shot width variation.
#To rectify this, inspect the screenshot widths produced against your configured widths,
#You can then add a bias value for each browser screen width as shown below.
#
#Note that when using URL-base comparison this issue shouldn't result in any diff image failures
#but nonetheless your captured screenshot widths may be different from those you stipulated.
